# Security-Policy-Development-Workshop

🔐 Security Policy Development Project

A curated set of practical, standards-aligned cybersecurity policies designed to enhance organizational security posture and support real-world compliance requirements. This project reflects hands-on experience in crafting clear, actionable, and comprehensive security documentation across key cybersecurity domains.

📌 Overview

This repository demonstrates my ability to develop enterprise-grade security policies that address critical areas of modern cybersecurity programs, including:

- Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) 
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)  
- Network and System Security  
- Security Incident Response & Detection 
- Data Protection & Acceptable Use 
-Alignment with industry frameworks such as ISO/IEC 27001, NIST CSF, and CIS Controls

Each policy is written to be clear, enforceable, and operationally relevant, suitable for adoption or adaptation in real-world security environments.


 🎯 Objectives

- Address common security, compliance, and operational needs in mid-to-large organizations  
- Translate technical risks and threats into practical policy guidance  
- Produce professional-grade documentation ready for enterprise use  
- Establish a repeatable foundation for audits, assessments, and regulatory alignment  
- Showcase structured, principle-driven policy development skills


 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

- Security policy design & technical writing  
- Cybersecurity governance & risk management  
- Threat modeling & mitigation strategy  
- Regulatory and framework alignment (NIST, ISO 27001, CIS)  
- Incident response planning & playbooks  
- Data classification & protection standards  
- Network and endpoint security best practices


📚 Planned Enhancements

- Expand policy library (e.g., BYOD, Remote Work, Email & Web Usage, Vendor Risk)  
- Add policy review templates and version control guidelines  
- Include workflow diagrams for approval, enforcement, and incident escalation  
- Map each policy to specific SANS, NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001, and CIS Control references  
- Provide sample security awareness training snippets linked to policies
